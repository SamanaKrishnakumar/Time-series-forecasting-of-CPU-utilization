# Time-series-forecasting-of-CPU-utilization
When multiple operations are going on in a particular System, it is difficult to find the CPU busy and idle time to start any new task.  To overcome this problem, this machine learning model that operates on given time series data of CPU and predicts the CPU idle time and busy time. The main aim of time series modelling is to carefully collect and rigorously study the past observations of a time series to develop an appropriate model which describes the inherent structure of the series.  This model is then used to generate future values for the series, i.e., to make forecasts.
